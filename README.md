# 📝 BlogEngine – Full Stack MERN Blog Platform

**BlogEngine** is a full-stack blog management system built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
It provides an **admin panel** where the admin can create and manage blog posts, and a **public interface** where all users can read blogs.

This project is designed with a focus on **performance, scalability, and clean architecture**, making it suitable for portfolios, academic projects, and real-world use cases.
